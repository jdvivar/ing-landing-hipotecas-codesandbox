# `<ing-landing-hipoteca>`
A landing page made with a single tag, ultra customisable via slots.

## Why?
This demo has one goal and one goal only: gain the love and conquer the hearts of a group of unconvinced yet creative skeptics that Web Components can be used to manage **web content** effortlessly... by anyone!

## How?
Web Components are extremely powerful. For this particular scenario ‚Äîwith the web content management mindset in place‚Äî the philosophy was about creating a simple and contentful experience by default, which could be tweaked later for other content.

This is the landing page used for inspiration:

https://www.ing.es/hipotecas/simula-hipoteca.html.

This is all the markup you need:
```html
<ing-landing-hipoteca></ing-landing-hipoteca>
```

... and this is the result:

## What technologies are being used?
I've tried to keep it simple (stupid, as in [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)). Just [LitElement](https://github.com/Polymer/lit-element) for defining Web Components and [Parcel](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel) for bundling and serving the app. For consistent code I used [Standard](https://github.com/standard/standard) as linter.

But you don't really need to know any of that to start, keep reading...

## FAQ

### I want to modify/add/remove X thing but it doesn't seem like any of these slots will do the work for me
Sure, ask me what you want to customise [opening an issue](https://github.com/jdvivar/ing-landing-hipotecas-demo/issues/new) and I'll do it as soon as I can.

### Where are the quotes around attribute values?
You might have noticed all the documentation is showing this:
```html
<tag attribute=value>
```
... instead of this:
```html
<tag attribute="value">
```
That is because:
1. It's perfectly valid, as long as you don't use whitespaces
1. Personally I think it's cleaner

To know more about unquoted attribute values read this [article by Mathias Bynens](https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/unquoted-attribute-values).

### Do you have unaddressed questions?

Please don't hesitate and [open an issue](https://github.com/jdvivar/ing-landing-hipotecas-demo/issues/new) assigning `question` as label. I'll answer as soon as I can plus you'll help improve this documentation.
