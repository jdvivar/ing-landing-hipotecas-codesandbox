# Just a Web Components demo for a landing page
A landing page made with a single tag, ultra customisable via slots.

## Why?

This demo has one goal and one goal only: gain the love and hearts from a group of people still unconvinced Web Components can be used to manage **web content** easily... by anyone! Anyone who's willing to learn that is.

The landing page is based on this one: https://www.ing.es/hipotecas/simula-hipoteca.html.

This is the result:

Web Components are extremely powerful. In this case, with the web content mindset in place, the philosophy was about creating a default experience that can be easily managed with just some markup.

## What technologies are being used?

I've tried to keep it simple (stupid, as in [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)). Just [LitElement](https://github.com/Polymer/lit-element) for defining Web Components and [Parcel](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel) for bundling and serving the app. For consistent code I used [Standard](https://github.com/standard/standard) as linter.

If you want to try it in the warmth of your computer instead, clone the repo and then just type:
```bash
$ npm install && npm start
```

## Things to try
For the following steps to work, just stay on [`index.html`](index.html)

```
### Subtitle
This will empty the subtitle
```html
<ing-landing-hipoteca>
    <slot slot=subtitulo></slot>

```
### Logo
This will paint a little ball of kitten furr instead of the logo and your heart will melt:
```html
<ing-landing-hipoteca>
